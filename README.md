# Shortest-Port-Scanner
This is a python-based "Port Scanner", used for scanning open ports on an IP address, but with this project. It uses the least lines of code possible.

### PS: this tool is slow, i wouldnt recommend using this script for a reliable port scanner, like, seriously. any other port scanner but this one
